# Living the simple life

## Description

This is a simple website made to practice and consolidate my HTML and CSS basic skills. It's also the first repository I ever created.

This small project is part of the [Learn Responsive Web Design](#https://scrimba.com/learn/responsive).

In this project I learned semantic HTML, Media Queries for Responsivness and basic CSS.
